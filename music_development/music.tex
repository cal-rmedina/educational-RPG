Generating the ambient and atmosphere of the videogame is crucial, so most of
the people should be involved in the creation of it, I've lsited some key
points to consider at the time of generationg the videogame.

\section{Format and duration}

Check the music files specifications, format (mp3, flac, etc), quality, duration.

\textcolor{blue}{This should be done at the same time we decide the software to use}

\section{Non copyright music}

Check the music we should use for the development of the game.

\textcolor{red}{TODO: Check the different sources to get music files whitout copyright}

\section{Creating our own 8-bit music}

Thinking about creating our own music:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If we decide going for the quantum mechanical project we could include
music created with quantum proceses like quantum numbers generators, every time
a number is generated, a note is played.
  \item If we decide creating machine learning music from a library, or samples read with voice reades like \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SzvsMFaek}{Fitter Happier} in 1997.

\end{itemize}
