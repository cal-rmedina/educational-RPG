# Development of RPG to teach physics 

The documentation includes de description of the project for further development, activities to do, perspectives and working plan. 

## Objective

First release of state-of-the-art [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) to teach physics.

## Things to do

The project is divided in several parts:

1. Finding a software (open source) to develop the project and start developing testing levels, the idea is to end up with an application similar to [Vim-adventures](https://vim-adventures.com) or any Pokemon, Paper Mario, Final Fantasy RPGs.

+ Definding the topics to be used inside the story, as a suggestion it could be (Check ".    /plot_stories/*" for more info):
  + Kinematics: collecting information inside the map to solve the final problem to finish the first level, it could be solving a pendulum, finding the maximum height, launching a projectile and finding the angle, find the escape velocity to put a satellite into orbit, etc.
  + Any topic the student suggests, it could be Quantum Mechanichs, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, space, etc.

3. Writting the plot and script to be developed, include battles and tasks to increase level.

4. Programming the level.

5. Include animations inside the levels.

6. Upload the first release on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
